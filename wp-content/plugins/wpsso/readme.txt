**WPSSO Core makes sure your content looks great on social and search sites -- no matter how URLs are crawled, shared, re-shared, posted, or embedded:**

WPSSO Core for WordPress is fast, simple, and provides complete information about your webpage content to social sites (Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.), search crawlers (Google, Bing, etc.), mail and messaging apps (Facebook Messenger, iMessage, Skype, WhatsApp, etc.), and embedded objects / iframes.

**Uses your *existing WordPress content* for meta tags and Schema markup:**

There's no need to manually select meta tag names, re-enter descriptions, titles, product information, select images / videos, etc. &mdash; WPSSO Core reads your existing post, page, product, media, recipe, event, forum, and SEO content automatically, and offers fine-tuning and customization options for just about anything and everything. ;-)

WPSSO Core is also language / locale aware, which means you can customize your site information, social page URLs and Knowledge Graph for different languages.

**Creates *complete and accurate* meta tags and Schema markup:**

WPSSO Core and its optional add-ons offer meta tags and Schema markup for Facebook / Open Graph, Google's Knowledge Graph, Google Rich Results SEO (see the [WPSSO JSON add-on](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-schema-json-ld/)), Google Merchant, Mobile Web Browsers, Pinterest Rich Pins, Twitter Cards, Weibo and many more &mdash; including complete markup for image SEO, video SEO, extensive e-Commerce product markup (for WooCommerce and others), mobile apps, author profile / authorship, co-authors, publisher information, local business markup, aggregate ratings, reviews, recipe information, event details, and much, much more &mdash; all from your existing WordPress content!

**Includes advanced *quality assurance* features and options:**

* Checks for minimum / maximum image dimensions and aspect ratios.
* Shows notices for missing and required images.
* Verifies webpages for duplicate meta tags.
* Validates theme header templates for correct HTML markup.
* Checks and warns of any missing PHP modules.
* Checks 3rd party plugin settings for possible conflicts.

<h3>Users Love the WPSSO Core Plugin</h3>

&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; &mdash; "The plugin is indispensable to me when it comes to posting on social media... it makes it so that your posts look the best that they possible can every time when posting on Facebook, Twitter, or any other site." - [monsuirette](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/this-is-probably-the-best-plugin-of-its-kind/)

&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; &mdash; "This plugin saves me so much time, and it has really lifted my SERP rankings. Most of my keywords I now rank 1-3 position. I also noticed after about a week that my impressions have gone up at least 75%. I upgraded to the pro version which gave me even more options." - [playnstocks](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/excellent-plugin-and-support-200/)

&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; &mdash; "Yoast on steroids! As an SEO marketer, I love using Yoast for my basic on-page SEO.

This plugin gives you SO many more options on completing the Open Graph for Facebook, Twitter cards, Pinterest etc. If you use WordPress, I totally recommend using this plugin to help with better rankings in the SERPS!" - [gregmontag](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/yoast-on-steroids/)
